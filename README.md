# BlackJack Project 

This is a little project that I am creating to dust up on my HTML, CSS and JS capabilities. 

This project will start basic enough as a simple BlackJack game where a player is able to draw two cards and then continuely draw until they either get a BlackJack or go bust.

Looking forward to seeing where this project goes!
